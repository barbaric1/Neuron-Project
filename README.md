To compile the program you have to go to the terminal, enter in the Buill folder, then write the comand cmake ..
Once that is done, you have to write the comand make
The last comand is ./neuron
To view different graphs you have to change the global constants "VARIABLE_RATIO" and "INHIBITORY_STRENGHT"

As a side note, as I couldn't find a way to use the phyton script for the creation of graphs that the assistents gave, I just borrowed it from my classmate Etienne under his permission, who found a much simpler way to do it in phyton. I don't think it should be a problem, as it wasn't expected from us to find a way to do it.

I should now dedicate a poem to Etienne, as he helped me with this great issue:

*Le rose sono rosse*

*le viole sono blue*

*Etienne, caro amico,*

*il pi√π bello sei tu*
